# One-Dimensional Ping-Pong Game

A hardware-only 1D "Ping-Pong" game implemented using the GreenPAK SLG46620V programmable logic device.

## üéÆ Game Description

This project implements a simple but engaging ping-pong game entirely in hardware - no microcontroller or software required! A single active bit (representing the ball) moves across a 6-LED array. When the ball reaches either edge, players must press a button within a brief time window to reflect it back.

### Gameplay Features
- **Ball Movement**: A shifting bit across 6 LEDs simulates ball movement
- **Player Input**: Button press required at edges (Q0 or Q5) to reflect the ball
- **Audio Feedback**: Buzzer sounds on successful hits
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Ball speed doubles every two successful reflections
- **Forgiving Design**: Missed balls restart from the opposite edge

## üîß Hardware Implementation

### Target Device
- **GreenPAK SLG46620V** - Dual-matrix programmable logic device

### Architecture Overview
The design utilizes both logic matrices of the SLG46620V:

- **Matrix0**: Handles user input, clock division, bounce detection logic, and buzzer control
- **Matrix1**: Contains the core 6-bit shift register for ball movement and directly drives LED outputs

### Key Components
- Clock divider for timing control
- 6-bit shift register for ball position tracking
- Direction control logic
- Input detection and timing windows
- Progressive speed control system
- Audio output control

## üéØ Project Goals

This project demonstrates:
- **Pure Hardware Logic**: Implementation without microcontrollers or software
- **Interactive Real-time Behavior**: Responsive gameplay using only configurable logic blocks
- **GreenPAK Capabilities**: Showcasing the potential of configurable logic for low-power embedded designs
